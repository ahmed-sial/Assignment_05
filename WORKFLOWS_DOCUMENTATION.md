# GitHub Actions Workflows Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the GitHub Actions workflows implemented for automated CI/CD, testing, deployment, and maintenance of the heavens-above project.

## 1. Continuous Integration (ci.yml)

### Purpose
Automated testing and code quality checks on every code change to ensure software quality.

### Triggers
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests targeting main branch

### Actions Performed
1. **Checkout code** - Retrieves latest source code
2. **Setup Node.js** - Configures Node.js environment (v18)
3. **Install dependencies** - Uses `npm ci` for clean installation
4. **Run tests** - Executes test suite using `npm test`
5. **Linting** - Code style validation using `npm run lint`
6. **Build verification** - Ensures project can be built successfully

### Interpreting Results
- **Green checkmark** ✅: All checks passed, code is ready
- **Red X** ❌: One or more checks failed, review logs for details
- **Yellow dot** ⚠️: Workflow in progress

## 2. Deployment Pipeline (deploy.yml)

### Purpose
Automated deployment to production environment following successful testing.

### Triggers
- Push to main branch (after CI passes)
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

### Actions Performed
1. **Environment setup** - Production environment with security
2. **Dependency installation** - Clean install using `npm ci`
3. **Test execution** - Final verification before deployment
4. **Project build** - Production build creation
5. **Deployment** - Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

### Security Features
- Uses GitHub's built-in token security
- Production environment protection
- Requires successful CI before deployment

## 3. Scheduled Tasks (scheduled-tasks.yml)

### Purpose
Automated maintenance tasks running on predefined schedule.

### Schedule
- **Daily at 2 AM UTC** (configurable via cron syntax)
- Manual trigger available

### Actions Performed
1. **Cleanup operations** - Temporary file cleanup
2. **Database maintenance** - Optional data optimization
3. **Notification** - Status reporting

## 4. Dependency Updates (dependabot.yml)

### Purpose
Automatically keep dependencies up to date and secure.

### Schedule
- Weekly dependency checks
- Automatic pull request creation

### Features
- npm package updates
- GitHub Actions updates
- Automatic reviewer assignment

## 5. Code Review Workflow (code-review.yml)

### Purpose
Automated code quality and security checks on pull requests.

### Triggers
- Pull request creation/update

### Actions Performed
1. **Code linting** - Style and syntax validation
2. **Security scanning** - Vulnerability detection
3. **Test coverage** - Ensure tests pass
4. **Bundle size analysis** - Performance monitoring

## 6. Documentation Deployment (documentation.yml)

### Purpose
Automatically build and deploy documentation changes.

### Triggers
- Changes to documentation files
- Manual trigger

### Actions Performed
1. **Documentation build** - Generate static site
2. **Deployment** - Publish to GitHub Pages

## 7. Custom Workflow (custom-workflow.yml)

### Purpose
Generate automated release notes for new releases.

### Triggers
- New GitHub release published

### Actions Performed
1. **Release notes generation** - Create detailed changelog
2. **Artifact creation** - Upload release notes as artifact
